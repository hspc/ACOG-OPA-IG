<h3> Overview </h3>
<p>
Family planning and related reproductive health services are essential elements of preventive health care, yet many aspects are not integrated and captured within electronic health record (EHR) systems. Measuring pregnancy intention, sexual activity history, and counseling related to contraception or achieving pregnancy are important health indicators that are not consistently captured by EHRs, yet are desired by clinicians, healthcare administrators, academic researchers, and government programs. The lack of standardized data capture for reporting, monitoring, and evaluation of family planning services to public health authorities places a burden on already stretched clinical providers. Additionally, many data elements important to family planning providers are critical to other clinical domains (e.g., blood pressure), while others are currently used primarily in family planning settings (e.g., clientâ€™s pregnancy intention). Standardized capture and recording of these variables across multiple clinical settings and diverse medical record documentation would facilitate more efficient reporting, adherence to clinical guidelines, and efforts to improve quality of service provision.

Within the Title X family planning program network, many of the 4,000 clinical service sites have an EHR capable of recording discrete patient data. Over 100 EHR vendors are represented across this network, however, necessitating the creation of interoperability standards that include standardized data elements using common terminologies. To cast a broad net, OPA has developed a CCDA-based profile with IHE International, in addition to this FHIR standard. All attempts were made to align the CCDA and FHIR standards and to use common terminologies.
